\begin{enumerate}
    \item The product of sets $A \times B$ is the Cartesian product of the sets, where $A \times B = \{(a,b) \mid a \in A, b \in B\}$. 
    \item A relation on a set $A$ is a subset of $A \times A$. Elaborately, a relation on a set $A$ takes two values from $A$ and puts them into a class based on how they are compared. 
    \item A relation is reflexive if for any $a \in A$, $aRa$, symmetric if $aRb \implies bRa$, and transitive if $aRb \land bRc \implies aRc$, where $b,c \in A$. 
    \item A relation on a set $A$ is an equivalence relation if it is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. An equivalence class of an element $a \in A$ is the set $\{x \in A \mid a \sim x\}$, which is the set of all members that are in $a$'s equivalence class.
    \item A partition of a set $A$ is a collection of disjoint subsets of $A$ (with each subset nonempty) such that their union is $A$. 
    \item $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime if $\gcd(a,b) = 1$. 
    \item The integers $b_1,\dots,b_n$ are relatively prime if $\gcd(b_1,\dots,b_n) = 1$. They are pairwise relatively prime if $\gcd(b_i,b_j) = 1$ for all $i \neq j$. 
    \item A prime number is an integer at least two whose factors are 1 and itself. A composite number is a number that isn't prime. 
    \item The prime factorization of a number $n$ is denoted $\prod_p p^{\alpha(p)}$, where this product symbolizes the product of all primes and the function $\alpha$ returns the exponent of a prime when considering that prime as its input.
    \item A congruence class (modulo $m$) is a set of all integers that are congruent modulo $m$. 
    \item A complete residue system (modulo $m$) is a set of integers $r_1,\dots,r_n$ such that any integer $x$ is congruent modulo $m$ to exactly of the $r_i$'s. 
    \item A reduced residue system (modulo $m$) is a set of integers $s_1,\dots,s_k$ coprime to $m$ such that any integer coprime to $m$ is congruent modulo $m$ to exactly one of the $s_i$'s. 
    \item Euler's totient function, $\phi(m)$, returns the number of elements in a reduced residue system modulo $m$. Equivalently, $\phi(m)$ is the number of integers $t$, with $0 < t \leq m$, such that $t$ is coprime to $m$. 
    \item Consider the integers modulo $m$. Then, take the integer $a$ in modulo $m$. Then, $a$ has a unique inverse (modulo $m$) $a^{-1}$ such that $aa^{-1} \equiv 1 \Mod{m}$. 
    \item A Gaussian integer is a complex number of the form $a + bi$, where $a,b \in \mathbb{Z}$. 
    \item $\mathbb{Z}[x]$ is the set of all polynomials with integer coefficients.
    \item The number of solutions to the congruence $f(x) \equiv g(x) \Mod{m}$ is the number of congruence classes that satisfy $f(x) - g(x) \equiv 0 \Mod{m}$. 
    \item Let $f(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \dots + a_0$, with $a_i \in \mathbb{Z}$ for all $i$. The degree of the congruence $f(x) \equiv 0 \Mod{m}$ is the highest value of $i$ such that $m \nmid a_i$, and undefined if $m \mid a_i$ for all $i$. To find the degree of the congruence $f(x) = g(x) \Mod{m}$ (with $f,g \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$), find the degree of $(f-g)(x) \equiv 0 \Mod{m}$. 
    \item A polynomial-time algorithm is an algorithm whose run time is a polynomial function of the length of its input.
    \item A weak probable prime to the base $a$ is a number $p>1$ that satisfies $a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \Mod{p}$. A weak pseudoprime to the base $a$ is a number $p>1$ that satisfies $a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \Mod{p}$ but $p$ is composite. 
    \item Consider the following algorithm: \\
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Find $j$ and $d$ odd such that $m-1 = 2^jd$. 
            \item If $a^d \equiv \pm 1 \Mod{m}$, then $m$ is a strong probable prime, stop. 
            \item Square $a^d$ to get $a^{2d}$. If $a^{2d} \equiv 1 \Mod{m}$, then $m$ is composite. If $a^{2d} \equiv -1 \Mod{m}$, then $m$ is a strong probable prime, stop. 
            \item Repeat this procedure for the list $a^{4d}, \dots, a^{2^{j-1}d}$. 
            \item If the procedure has not yet terminated, $m$ is composite. 
        \end{enumerate}
    If the test is inconclusive, then $m$ is composite. $m$ is a strong pseudoprime to the base $a$ if the test with $m$ is conclusive but $m$ is both odd and composite. 
    \item A Carmichael number is a composite number $m$ which is a weak pseudoprime to the base $a$ for all integers $a$ coprime to $m$. 
    \item $p^\alpha$ exactly divides $n$ (denote: $p^\alpha \mid\mid n$) if $p^\alpha \mid n$ but $p^{\alpha + 1} \nmid n$. 
\end{enumerate}
